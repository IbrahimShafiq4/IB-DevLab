# IBDevLab – Interactive Front-End Experiments & Components

**IBDevLab** is a personal design lab for experimenting with creative front-end concepts, micro-interactions, and reusable UI components. It serves as a growing collection of visually engaging and interactive web projects built with modern web technologies.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project is a playground for crafting polished user interface elements, animation effects, and utility tools. Each item is carefully designed to be modular, accessible, and ready to inspire or be reused in larger applications.
